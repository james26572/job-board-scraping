Booking a trip yourself is a time-consuming and painful experience. And everyone ends up going to the same places and doing the same things. With Journee, we\'ve created a way for you to go on an adventure you never knew you needed. All we need is 10 minutes of your time to fill in our questionnaire.Journee boasts a 4.9 TrustPilot score with over 1000 reviews and is post-Product Market Fit.

Technology underpins the growth aspirations of Journee, and as an early team member you\xe2\x80\x99ll be critical in helping us leverage technology and apply it to the B2C travel space.To achieve scale and bring Journee to as many people as possible, we are automating large parts of the customer journey that is traditionally handled manually, all the way from when a potential traveller first hears about us to when they come back from their trip.There are a lot of roles in tech where the consumer is distant and the technical work is undifferentiated between different sectors. This is not one of those roles. We\xe2\x80\x99re very close to our travellers and get to share in their journey, and everything we work on is to support that.You areA problem solver with a passion for automation.Curious, with a strong desire to learn; you want to understand how things work. You probably keep up with new technologies, follow relevant newsletters & blogs, and maybe attend meetups & conferences.An adaptable generalist, capable of finding the balance between speed of delivery and completeness. We\xe2\x80\x99re at an early stage, so done is better than perfect, we like to move fast.A proactive person who wants more than just to be handed pre-defined tasks.

This currently encompasses our Journee Passport and various change forms for leads. Next year we will start on an app, continue to offer travellers more flexibility, and offer a new way to receive a proposal. Basic frontend work will be an optional part of this role.Building new features from scratch and making improvements to our internal systems. This includes continuing to innovate on the data layer that both describes trips that we offer for matchmaking, and allows delivery and management of trips once booked.Expanding the capabilities of our Journee matchmaking technology.

All because the industry hasn\xe2\x80\x99t given this huge cohort of people a second\xe2\x80\x99s thought, and isn\xe2\x80\x99t set up to price them properly.We saw an opportunity to do things differently, so we made it our mission to back the ones who step outside the norm. Since we started, we\xe2\x80\x99ve helped 100,000s of people get a fairer deal on their car insurance. Using technology, we serve people that are often overlooked by financial services companies, solving important problems for people who need it most.We know there are millions of marginalised customers out there. And we know that they face unique problems that most companies aren\xe2\x80\x99t even aware of. We believe that our future is helping these people by learning about their experiences, and building our company around their needs. And there are strong signs that there\xe2\x80\x99s a need for a company like us.

We take risks, think creatively and experiment relentlessly to meet our customer\xe2\x80\x99s needs, and never pass blame when things go wrong. We encourage people at all levels to take ownership of their work, and to be bold in challenging how we do things. Everyone has a voice and the opportunity to make an impact.And autonomy and ownership are only possible with clear direction. That\xe2\x80\x99s why we collaborate to do in-depth planning twice a year, and make sure we leave with clear goals and objectives that flow from top to bottom. To make sure we\xe2\x80\x99re as aligned as possible across functions, most of our work rolls up into four tribes; Acquisition, Retention, Claims and Pricing, Underwriting & Fraud.

As organisations rely more on cloud services and the Internet, the network has become a \xe2\x80\x9cblack box\xe2\x80\x9d outside of their control. ThousandEyes gives organisations visibility and insight into the now borderless network. It arms them with an accurate understanding of how the network impacts their applications, users and customers.

As we embark on the exciting journey of upgrading the recently acquired SamKnows platform, we are in the process of integrating it into ThousandEyes at the same time. This is a unique opportunity to not just update, but to fundamentally transform and modernise our systems, influencing how our applications operate and interact with the world.About The RoleLast year, ThousandEyes acquired SamKnows, and, in an era where connectivity is paramount, the acquisition of SamKnows marks a significant step forward in our mission to enhance network visibility and performance, particularly in the critical last-mile segment and within consumer homes. This integration empowers Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and consumers with insightful data to identify connectivity and application issues, whether they originate in the home or beyond.We are looking for a Software Engineer to help us with this transition by joining our web development team. This team is responsible for developing client facing web applications as an integrated product team, together with product managers and designers. Our developers are empowered to be involved in and feed into the decision-making process, using their diverse range of backgrounds and experiences to advocate for users and ensure we build the best possible solutions.What You Will DoYou will be joining our web development team and will be a key contributor in creating web applications, back-end services and APIs for our client-facing desktop and mobile sites.

As a senior developer, you will provide help, guidance and support to other developers, and be instrumental in shaping the direction of our code.The majority of our backend code is written in modern PHP; however, some of our newer, performance-critical projects are written in different languages such as Java or Go, and the technical direction is to start migrating all of our PHP APIs to a Java or Kotlin stack. Our frontend is written using Vue2 and Vue3, using Typescript and Vite. We target modern browsers and use websockets as well as any web standards that are able to best solve our problems. We are firm advocates of using the best tools for the job.Our backend services and APIs interact with our vast measurement dataset in one way or another. Our software is installed on more than 30 million devices globally, and this figure is growing daily. To store and access our data we use a blend of database technologies to power our platform, including GCP BigQuery and Kafka, and we also use MySQL for our globally distributed metadata store. We use Docker for containerisation on both front-end and back-end repositories.Required Skills Enjoyment in building products with solid architecture and seeing them through to deployment.  Proven experience in designing and building systems that are scalable and well-tested.  Professional development experience in PHP 7 or 8.  Some experience with modern frontend frameworks such as Vue, Angular, React or Svelte.  Some experience working with Java, Kotlin, or similar backend languages.

All because the industry hasn\xe2\x80\x99t given this huge cohort of people a second\xe2\x80\x99s thought, and isn\xe2\x80\x99t set up to price them properly.We saw an opportunity to do things differently, so we made it our mission to back the ones who step outside the norm. Since we started, we\xe2\x80\x99ve helped 100,000s of people get a fairer deal on their car insurance. Using technology, we serve people that are often overlooked by financial services companies, solving important problems for people who need it most.We know there are millions of marginalised customers out there. And we know that they face unique problems that most companies aren\xe2\x80\x99t even aware of. We believe that our future is helping these people by learning about their experiences, and building our company around their needs. And there are strong signs that there\xe2\x80\x99s a need for a company like us.

We take risks, think creatively and experiment relentlessly to meet our customer\xe2\x80\x99s needs, and never pass blame when things go wrong. We encourage people at all levels to take ownership of their work, and to be bold in challenging how we do things. Everyone has a voice and the opportunity to make an impact.And autonomy and ownership are only possible with clear direction.

All because the industry hasn\xe2\x80\x99t given this huge cohort of people a second\xe2\x80\x99s thought, and isn\xe2\x80\x99t set up to price them properly.We saw an opportunity to do things differently, so we made it our mission to back the ones who step outside the norm. Since we started, we\xe2\x80\x99ve helped 100,000s of people get a fairer deal on their car insurance. Using technology, we serve people that are often overlooked by financial services companies, solving important problems for people who need it most.We know there are millions of marginalised customers out there. And we know that they face unique problems that most companies aren\xe2\x80\x99t even aware of. We believe that our future is helping these people by learning about their experiences, and building our company around their needs. And there are strong signs that there\xe2\x80\x99s a need for a company like us. Earlier this year we hit profitability, which is a huge milestone, but the most exciting thing is that we\xe2\x80\x99re only just getting started.How We WorkWe\xe2\x80\x99re really proud of the culture we\xe2\x80\x99ve created. We push for progress every day, because we know that we\xe2\x80\x99ll only hit big milestones by taking lots of smaller steps. We\xe2\x80\x99re always open to helping our team mates, sharing our ideas, experience and knowledge to solve problems together. We take risks, think creatively and experiment relentlessly to meet our customer\xe2\x80\x99s needs, and never pass blame when things go wrong. We encourage people at all levels to take ownership of their work, and to be bold in challenging how we do things. Everyone has a voice and the opportunity to make an impact.And autonomy and ownership are only possible with clear direction. That\xe2\x80\x99s why we collaborate to do in-depth planning twice a year, and make sure we leave with clear goals and objectives that flow from top to bottom. To make sure we\xe2\x80\x99re as aligned as possible across functions, most of our work rolls up into four tribes; Acquisition, Retention, Claims and Pricing, Underwriting & Fraud. Each tribe has multiple teams embedded in it, working cross-functionally to do great work.We\xe2\x80\x99re so excited for all of the challenges up ahead, and we need more people to help us tackle them!

High quality reusable alternatives are available. When managed properly they last for years and reduce costs.So why aren\'t more companies using reusable packaging?The main problem is that it is almost impossible to manage the use cycle for reusable packaging without active tracking. There are so many opportunities for items to end up in the wrong place as they move from manufacturer to retail distribution center, to shop, to customer, to washing facility and back to the manufacturer. Packages without tracking fall out of the cycle and are lost.Sensize tracking technology allows customers to track their packaging fleet and makes it cost effective to replace disposable packaging with high quality reusable alternatives. This is a significant growth area with logistics companies keen to reduce their environmental footprint. We have customers in Europe and the US and due to increasing demand we are looking to grow our development team.The OpportunityWith millions of devices constantly reporting data, infrastructure code is core to the Sensize system. You will be working on the suite of components that comprise this as well as developing tools to assist with data management and presentation.As part of a relatively small team, you will also have the opportunity to get involved in other areas of development according to interest and business need.Main Tasks & ResponsibilitiesDevelopment and enhancement of Sensize customer portal including data visualization and analysis.Assist with operational analysis of devicesAssist with deployment and management of servicesAssist with customer technical queriesOur Development EnvironmentSource control and issue tracking: Azure DevOps (using git repos)Editing/IDE: Visual Studio Professional, VS-CodeProductivity: Resharper, NCrunchOther: PowerShell, KQL.Net 8RequirementsSkills and ExperienceThe successful applicant will need to have good skills and experience with:C#, JavascriptASP.Net/BlazorAzure Services (Table/Blob storage, Functions, Web APIs, Active Directory)Creating user-friendly UXIn addition, some experience with one or more of the following may be advantageous:PowerShellPowerBiMobile developmentBenefitsExcellent salaryPension contributionStock optionsWe believe in equal opportunitiesEnsuring a diverse and inclusive workplace is our priority.
